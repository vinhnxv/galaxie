# Conformance suite

The suite compares twelve deterministic graph cases in three lanes:

| Lane | Runtime and context | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native Node | Root `@langchain/langgraph` with native Node async context | [`native.node.test.ts`](native.node.test.ts) |
| galaxie on Node | The adapter's `/web` import with the synchronous context shim | [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts), Node project |
| galaxie in Chromium | The same adapter and cases in headless Chromium, without Node polyfills | [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts), Chromium project; [`browser-smoke.test.ts`](browser-smoke.test.ts) |

Only the native Node lane owns the files under [`golden/`](golden/). It normalizes generated IDs and timestamps and compares the transcript to its golden. The galaxie lanes compare normalized stream events, final state, checkpoint history, interrupts and resume against those same goldens. Both the in-memory saver and the IndexedDB saver cover `async`, `sync` and `exit` durability modes.

[`indexeddb.test.ts`](indexeddb.test.ts) reruns all twelve cases in Chromium with `@galaxie/storage-indexeddb`. It requires exactly the existing `galaxie-chromium` matrix differences; it adds no matrix lane. Each test creates and deletes its own database. `runGalaxie` accepts an optional saver factory and a `stopAtInterrupt` flag for graph-level reload tests; existing callers keep the in-memory default.

The reload tests pause `interrupt-resume`, `interrupt-subgraph` and both durability cases through the runtime, dispose it, close the saver, and rebuild the graph over a new saver on the same database and thread. The pending interrupt ID and value, `value`, `answer` and `state.next` match the original pause and goldens. Rebuilt closure counters are asserted separately: `{ prepare: 0, ask: 1 }`, or `{ callSub: 1, s1: 0, sask: 1 }` for the subgraph. The native `interrupt()` driver uses `runWithConfig` after the fixture's await under the browser shim.

**Repeated completed resume baseline (LangGraph 1.5.1, checkpoint 1.2.0):** after another close/reopen and graph rebuild, submitting the same interrupt ID again leaves the final state unchanged and emits no node updates in all four reload cases. This observes the graph's behavior after a completed resume; a persistent submission inbox, effect reconciliation and runtime/UI session adoption remain later M3 slices.

[`compatibility-matrix.json`](compatibility-matrix.json) lists an observed case/lane difference as exact JSON paths with a reason. [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts) requires the computed difference set to equal the listed set: an unlisted difference or a stale listed difference fails. [`support/matrix.ts`](support/matrix.ts) validates case/lane names, unique entries and paths, and non-empty reasons. The matrix records transcript differences; it is not an API inventory.

Additional tests in this directory run on both Node and Chromium unless their filename ends in `.node.test.ts` or they are the Chromium-only `indexeddb.test.ts`. They cover runtime controls beyond transcript parity. The single guarantee-to-code-and-test map is in [system design §9](../../docs/system-design.md#9-security-baseline-map).

## Explicit config and context

Both galaxie lanes import only `/web`. During the first `prepare`, the adapter installs its synchronous context shim only if no global LangChain context instance exists. The following are observed at the pinned versions:

| API or context rule | Required usage under the shim | Proving test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requestInteraction(request, config)` after an `await` | Pass the node's `config`; the helper scopes stock `interrupt()` synchronously and preserves interrupt-ID resume | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `requestInteraction after await pauses and resumes through explicit config` |
| Stock `interrupt()` using implicit context | Implicit context is confined to the node's synchronous prefix. After an `await`, use `requestInteraction(request, config)` | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `stock interrupt after await fails with executor_error under the shim`; [`interaction.test.ts`](../../packages/adapter-langgraph/test/interaction.test.ts): `runWithConfig exposes the config under the synchronous shim` |
| An agent-held chat model using implicit config | Config propagation works in the synchronous prefix; pass config explicitly across asynchronous work | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `a model called without config in the synchronous prefix emits messages` |
| Routed `host.langchain.chatModel(role)` calls | Always pass the node's `config` for stream callbacks and model span parenting, including in the synchronous prefix. Routing still executes without config, but its asynchronous policy and credential work loses implicit callbacks | [`tracing.test.ts`](tracing.test.ts): `a model without forwarded config has a node span and no implicit model span`; the `model-without-config` entries in [`compatibility-matrix.json`](compatibility-matrix.json) |
| Node context installation | Initialize real `AsyncLocalStorage` before the first adapter `prepare` when other LangChain code needs async context. Installation is first-writer-wins; the adapter preserves an existing global instance | [`interaction.test.ts`](../../packages/adapter-langgraph/test/interaction.test.ts): `context installation preserves a pre-existing global instance` |

The table lists tested behavior rather than every LangChain context API. The adapter does not import Node context modules or replace an existing context instance.

## Running the suite

- `pnpm check` runs the repository's license, lint, both TypeScript compilers, Node/Chromium tests, build and dependency checks.
- `CI=true pnpm test` runs both test projects without writing missing goldens.
- `pnpm test tests/conformance/galaxie.test.ts` runs the twelve parity cases on both galaxie lanes.

Goldens are updated only by the native Node snapshot command, `pnpm conformance:update`, when intentionally changing the baseline. Review any resulting diff. Runtime control work must leave the existing goldens and compatibility matrix unchanged.
