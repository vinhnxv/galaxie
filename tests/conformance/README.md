# Conformance suite

The suite compares twelve deterministic graph cases in three lanes:

| Lane | Runtime and context | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native Node | Root `@langchain/langgraph` with native Node async context | [`native.node.test.ts`](native.node.test.ts) |
| galaxie on Node | The adapter's `/web` import with the synchronous context shim | [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts), Node project |
| galaxie in Chromium | The same adapter and cases in headless Chromium, without Node polyfills | [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts), Chromium project; [`browser-smoke.test.ts`](browser-smoke.test.ts) |

Only the native Node lane owns the files under [`golden/`](golden/). It normalizes generated IDs and timestamps and compares the transcript to its golden. The galaxie lanes compare normalized stream events, final state, checkpoint history, interrupts and resume against those same goldens. The in-memory saver covers `async`, `sync` and `exit` durability modes; reload persistence and repeated resume after a crash belong to M3 and the IndexedDB saver.

[`compatibility-matrix.json`](compatibility-matrix.json) lists an observed case/lane difference as exact JSON paths with a reason. [`galaxie.test.ts`](galaxie.test.ts) requires the computed difference set to equal the listed set: an unlisted difference or a stale listed difference fails. [`support/matrix.ts`](support/matrix.ts) validates case/lane names, unique entries and paths, and non-empty reasons. The matrix records transcript differences; it is not an API inventory.

Additional tests in this directory run on both Node and Chromium unless their filename ends in `.node.test.ts`. They cover runtime controls beyond transcript parity. The single guarantee-to-code-and-test map is in [system design §9](../../docs/system-design.md#9-security-baseline-map).

## Explicit config and context

Both galaxie lanes import only `/web`. During the first `prepare`, the adapter installs its synchronous context shim only if no global LangChain context instance exists. The following are observed at the pinned versions:

| API or context rule | Required usage under the shim | Proving test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requestInteraction(request, config)` after an `await` | Pass the node's `config`; the helper scopes stock `interrupt()` synchronously and preserves interrupt-ID resume | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `requestInteraction after await pauses and resumes through explicit config` |
| Stock `interrupt()` using implicit context | Implicit context is confined to the node's synchronous prefix. After an `await`, use `requestInteraction(request, config)` | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `stock interrupt after await fails with executor_error under the shim`; [`interaction.test.ts`](../../packages/adapter-langgraph/test/interaction.test.ts): `runWithConfig exposes the config under the synchronous shim` |
| An agent-held chat model using implicit config | Config propagation works in the synchronous prefix; pass config explicitly across asynchronous work | [`interaction-context.test.ts`](interaction-context.test.ts): `a model called without config in the synchronous prefix emits messages` |
| Routed `host.langchain.chatModel(role)` calls | Always pass the node's `config` for stream callbacks and model span parenting, including in the synchronous prefix. Routing still executes without config, but its asynchronous policy and credential work loses implicit callbacks | [`tracing.test.ts`](tracing.test.ts): `a model without forwarded config has a node span and no implicit model span`; the `model-without-config` entries in [`compatibility-matrix.json`](compatibility-matrix.json) |
| Node context installation | Initialize real `AsyncLocalStorage` before the first adapter `prepare` when other LangChain code needs async context. Installation is first-writer-wins; the adapter preserves an existing global instance | [`interaction.test.ts`](../../packages/adapter-langgraph/test/interaction.test.ts): `context installation preserves a pre-existing global instance` |

The table lists tested behavior rather than every LangChain context API. The adapter does not import Node context modules or replace an existing context instance.

## Running the suite

- `pnpm check` runs the repository's license, lint, both TypeScript compilers, Node/Chromium tests, build and dependency checks.
- `CI=true pnpm test` runs both test projects without writing missing goldens.
- `pnpm test tests/conformance/galaxie.test.ts` runs the twelve parity cases on both galaxie lanes.

Goldens are updated only by the native Node snapshot command, `pnpm conformance:update`, when intentionally changing the baseline. Review any resulting diff. Runtime control work must leave the existing goldens and compatibility matrix unchanged.
